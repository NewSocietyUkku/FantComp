What is [fantasy computing]

Computers science plays an essential role in the world around us. The more effective computers will get, the greater this role will be. In order to ensure progress, every citizen is expected to have an in-depth knowledge of computer science. This is easier said than done, as can be seen by the difficulties involved in the literacy campaigns to get people to be able to read and write. 

To assist with ‘computer science literacy’, there is a fictional universe created with aim of teaching computer science to the public. The name of this fictional universe is called [fantasy computing]. Every concept that exist in computer science is represented in this fictional universe, as magic, goblins or whatever other concepts people find more interesting than computer science itself.  Then when ever they watch a movie, read a book, etc, they will be learning these key components and then can make use this knowledge at a later stage.

What is [fantasy operating system] 

This is an computer based operating system that is to be designed to applicable to the rules set out in [fantasy computing]. Therefore, making it accessible to the masses to be able to use it as a powerful tool, not just to understand the surface level applications of it. Whether the operating system is created from scratch or simple is another per-existing operating system that has been modified,  it makes no difference. What is important however, is that it follows the rules set out by [fantasy computing]. The language of this operating system also needs to be made to be the official language of the new state.


constitution to be followed when designing software

Everything in the software designed, including the [fantasy operating system] and coding languages, need to be governed by certain ideals. There is a ‘constitution’ listing all the ideals that need to be followed when designing software.

0. All software must be designed to be inline with the rules of [fantasy computing].

1. For any interface that requires input from user, where a graphical interface exists, there must also a be a text based terminal interface. Anything you do on the graphical interface, you must be able to do in the terminal. All actions in the graphical interface will create writing in the terminal, by default. Users can choose to hide or expose this terminal, and therefore can learn to navigate the terminal commands, using the graphical interface.

2. The software must completely reflect the hardware it applies to. For example, if you have two solid state drives and a movie is saved between the two of them, one should be able to see this on screen. It should be clear to any user, without the need to look into it, that the movie is partly saved in one solid state drive and partly saved in another.

3. The user must be giving full control of their experience. For example, if the user wishes to use a cellphone like a computer, there should be no restrictions to do so. Computers and cellphones are both electronic computing devices and therefore can be operated in the same way. Users are to decide what their experience would be, rather than a designer dictating that for them. The whole thing must be build around control. If the user wishes to stop earphones from being connected, they should be able to do so. Even if the earphones are physically plugged in.

4.  For any interface that requires input from user, there must be a method to do it more quickly. For example, in the [fantasy operating system], one may program short cut keys to automatically type in commands in the terminal. The user has full control to decides which keys to use and they program how they work. This saves them time, as they don’t need to write out long commands.

5. Permissions are essential. Nothing can be opened without your permission. That means software needs your permission to access/change something. There also exists a permission system for this that, is similar to Unix or Linux, in terms of accessing and editing files.

6. The hardware must be intuitive and follow consistent rules, that cannot contradict each other. These rules should be logical. In other words, a user should be able to use logic to work out how something works, without being taught it beforehand. The more you use these systems with these rules, the more intuitive it must become. The software should just feel right, to anyone using it. A child should be able to play around with it and begin to work out how it works.

7. Consistency is key. If something does one thing, it cannot do something else another time. Once something has been determined as doing one thing, it is always to do that one thing. For example, if a button appears in one part of the screen, it mustn’t change places to appear in another part of the screen: or if a function, like right clicking, does one thing, it cannot go and do something else later.

8. It needs to be error resistant. It must be difficult to make mistakes when tired or working quickly. For example, having two buttons close to each other, in a graphical interface, can result in the wrong one being clicked by accident: or having two text commands in the terminal that are almost identical to each other, can cause the wrong command to be entered.

9. One should always have the option to turn all letters to equal spacing. This is so that text can be more easier to work with and so that one can easily determine the size of certain texts. For example, ‘www’ should take up no more space than ‘lll’. The [Ukkku language does not make use of these characters but the point still stands that ‘www’ is larger than ‘lll’
‘www’
‘lll’

[fantasy computing]

All computing is divided into different levels. The lowest levels being the physics that govern electrons and transistors. Then you get another lever that governs circuit boards. This goes on until you get the highest levels of computer software, hardware, computer networks, etc. Each level has a different magical creature and realm to represent it. For example, the realm of the hobbits. The rules that govern the real world, are giving fictional justifications in these realms. As a person learns the back story, they learn the rules that govern these computing components in real life. Which magical creatures are used is not important. What is important however, is that this fictional universe is exciting and makes people interested. It is also essential that this fictional universe represents the existing rules of computing, making it easy to understand.

Additional Hardware
Due to the [Ukku language] using different characters than the standard keyboard, a different keyboard will be needed. This keyboard also should have separate buttons for passwords. Passwords are not entered by the normal keys. Instead, they are entered by separate buttons with shapes on them. This is to prevent someone accidentally entering a password in plain text or to prevent phishers, getting people to enter their passwords in the wrong places.
